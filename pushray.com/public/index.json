[{"content":"Today, we\u0026rsquo;re excited to introduce Pushray — a new way to share files privately, securely, and with a revenue model that rewards creators directly.\nMost file-sharing tools take one of two paths:\nthey either lock you into subscriptions, or they monetize your data and activity.\nPushray takes a different approach.\nWhy Pushray? #1. Privacy comes first #Every file shared through Pushray is encrypted end-to-end.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t read your files, track your activity, or build profiles about you.\nSecurity and privacy are defaults — not features.\n2. A clean, usage-based model #Instead of monthly fees, Pushray is simple:\ndownloaders pay only when they download, and uploaders earn a share of the revenue.\nThis aligns incentives in a way traditional platforms never did.\nGreat content is rewarded, not hidden behind ads or algorithms.\n3. Designed for creators and individuals alike #Whether you\u0026rsquo;re sharing:\nbook summaries audio guides research files templates digital assets …or anything else you want delivered securely, Pushray helps you share without worrying about bandwidth cost, storage, or tracking.\nHow It Works # Upload your file (encrypted automatically) Share your link Downloads consume free bandwidth first When free quota is used up, downloaders pay a small fee You earn a share of that fee Simple, transparent, and fair.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next #This is just the beginning.\nOver the coming months, Pushray will introduce:\ncreator tools analytics that respect privacy better previews improved audio and long-form content support API access for developers We\u0026rsquo;re building this platform with long-term security and transparency in mind — not quick growth hacks.\nFinal Thoughts #Pushray is our answer to a simple question:\nHow can file sharing be private, fair, and sustainable at the same time?\nWe\u0026rsquo;re excited for you to try it, share your work, and help shape what comes next.\nStay tuned — more updates are coming soon.\n","date":"1 December 2025","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/introducing-pushray/","section":"Posts","summary":"Today, we\u0026rsquo;re excited to introduce \u003cstrong\u003ePushray\u003c/strong\u003e — a new way to share files privately, securely, and with a revenue model that rewards creators directly","title":"📌 Introducing Pushray: A Privacy-First Platform for Secure, Encrypted Sharing"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/categories/announcement/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Announcement"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/tags/privacy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Privacy"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/tags/product/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Product"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/tags/pushray/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pushray"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"Insights on private sharing, secure distribution, and the future of creator-driven file ecosystems.\nWelcome to the Pushray Blog — a space where product updates, technical deep dives, creator strategies, and visions about the future of encrypted sharing come together.\nPushray is redefining how people share files: private, encrypted, usage-based, and rewarding to uploaders.\nNo subscriptions.
