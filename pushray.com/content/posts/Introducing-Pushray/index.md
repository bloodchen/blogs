Today, we're excited to introduce **Pushray** — a new way to share files privately, securely, and with a revenue model that rewards creators directly.

Most file-sharing tools take one of two paths:  
they either lock you into subscriptions, or they monetize your data and activity.  
Pushray takes a different approach.

## Why Pushray?

### **1. Privacy comes first**

Every file shared through Pushray is encrypted end-to-end.  
We don't read your files, track your activity, or build profiles about you.  
Security and privacy are defaults — not features.

### **2. A clean, usage-based model**

Instead of monthly fees, Pushray is simple:  
**downloaders pay only when they download**, and **uploaders earn a share of the revenue**.

This aligns incentives in a way traditional platforms never did.  
Great content is rewarded, not hidden behind ads or algorithms.

### **3. Designed for creators and individuals alike**

Whether you're sharing:

- book summaries
- audio guides
- research files
- templates
- digital assets

…or anything else you want delivered securely, Pushray helps you share without worrying about bandwidth cost, storage, or tracking.

## How It Works

1. Upload your file (encrypted automatically)
2. Share your link
3. Downloads consume free bandwidth first
4. When free quota is used up, downloaders pay a small fee
5. **You earn a share of that fee**

Simple, transparent, and fair.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning.  
Over the coming months, Pushray will introduce:

- creator tools
- analytics that respect privacy
- better previews
- improved audio and long-form content support
- API access for developers

We're building this platform with long-term security and transparency in mind — not quick growth hacks.

## Final Thoughts

Pushray is our answer to a simple question:

**How can file sharing be private, fair, and sustainable at the same time?**

We're excited for you to try it, share your work, and help shape what comes next.

Stay tuned — more updates are coming soon.
